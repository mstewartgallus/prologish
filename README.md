It is well known one can compile higher order abstract syntax to a
closed cartesian category.  This project flips the arrows compiling
the higher order abstract syntax to the categorical dual.  I'm not
sure of the best interpretation of a category but I eventually settled
on trying to make it work something like a logic programming languaage.
